## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
The Problem Statement for this project is pretty straight forward “How can an existing mail ordercompany selling organic products can acquire more number of clients in order to expand their business?”
The proposed solution is divided into 2 subparts.The first part would deal with the segmentation of the customers using unsupervised machine learningtechniques based on the intersection of the data with current customers and population provided.Secondly, a supervised model will be used to predict the outcome whether or not a customer is likely tobe in the targeted audience or not.

The project is divided into several subtasks:
1.	Data Analysis and Preprocessing;
2.	Customer Segmentation Report;
3.	Supervised Learning Predictive Model;
4.	Kaggle Competition;

The training data is protected under the Terms and Conditions and is unavailable for public sharing.

• Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were
targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).
• Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets
of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).
Additionally, there were 2 more files for describing attributes:
• DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx: Explains values encoding.
• DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx: Explains column names meanings.
MAILOUT_TRAIN and MAILOU_TEST are provided for the building training and testing a supervised
model. The training data is protected under the Terms and Conditions and is unavailable for public sharing.





## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
The dataset used in this project is proprietary and is not usable for those outside of this nanodegree.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The second part would deal with the segmentation of the customers using unsupervised machine learningtechniques based on the intersection of the data with current customers and population provided. 


In third part, a supervised model will be used to predict the outcome whether or not a customer is likely tobe in the targeted audience or not
